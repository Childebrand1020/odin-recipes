    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been
        combined with other ingredients and formed into the
        shape of a loaf, then baked or smoked.
        The final shape is either hand-formed
        on a baking tray, or pan-formed 
        by cooking it in a loaf pan.

        <li>2/3 cups crushed saltine crackers (about 16) 
            or quick oatmeal or 1 1/3 cups fresh bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup minced parsley</li>
        <li>6 ounces thin-sliced bacon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step-by-Step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the glaze: Mix all ingredients 
            in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>or the meatloaf: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
            Heat oil in a medium skillet. Add onion and garlic, 
            saute until softened, about 5 minutes; 
            set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Mix eggs with thyme, salt, pepper, mustard, 
            Worchestershire, pepper sauce, and milk or yogurt. 
            Add egg mixture to meat in a large bowl, 
            along with crackers, oatmeal or bread crumbs, 
            parsley and cook onions and garlic; 
            mix with a fork until evenly blended 
            and meat mixture does not stick to bowl. 
            (If mixture does stick, add additional milk, 
            a couple tablespoons at a time, 
            and continue stirring until mixture stops sticking.)</li>
        <li>Turn meat mixture onto a work surface. With wet hands, 
            pat mixture into a loaf approximately 9 by 5 inches.</li>
        <li>Cover a wire rack with foil; prick foil in several
             places with a fork. Place a rack on a shallow 
            roasting pan lined with foil for easy cleanup.</li>
        <li>Set formed loaf on rack. Brush loaf with all of glaze, 
            then arrange bacon slices, crosswise,
             over loaf, overlapping them 
            slightly and tucking them under 
            to prevent curling.</li>
        <li>Bake loaf until bacon is crisp and loaf registers 
            160 degrees, about 1 hour. 
            Cool for at least 20 minutes. Slice and serve</li>
