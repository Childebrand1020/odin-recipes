        <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>

        <li>2/3 cup frozen peas, 
            rinsed under warm tap water 
            for a few seconds thaw</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked jasmine rice (preferably leftover 
            from at least a day before, 
            see Recipe Note)</li>
        <li>2 scallions, sliced (separate the white and light green 
            parts from the dark green part)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder, optional</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Step-by-Step</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the chicken into small 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch cubes. 
                Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of salt over the 
                chicken and mix to combine. 
                Set the chicken aside for about 10 minutes .</li>
            <li>Heat a wok or large saut√© pan over medium-high heat. 
                Swirl in a tablespoon of oil and add the whisked eggs. 
                Use a spatula to quickly scramble the eggs, 
                breaking the curds into smaller pieces as 
                they come together. 
                Transfer the eggs to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add another tablespoon of oil in the wok or pan. 
                Add the chicken and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, 
                stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and transfer 
                the cooked chicken to a plate.

                Using your spatula, scrape off any chicken bits that are 
                still stuck to the wok so they don't burn during the next step. 
                You can also use paper towels to wipe down your wok or pan.</li>
            <li>Swirl 1 tablespoon of oil into the wok over 
                medium-high heat. Add the diced onions and cook them 
                for 1 minute, until they start to soften. 
                Mix in the minced garlic and ginger and cook until 
                fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the diced carrots and 
                cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add 1/2 
                teaspoon salt and the peas, and stir to incorporate.</li>
            <li>Add the rice to the wok or pan on top of the 
                vegetables and stir to combine. Using the back of
                your spatula, smash any large chunks of rice to break 
                them apart. Add the white and green parts of the 
                sliced scallions (save the dark green parts) and 
                five-spice powder. Stir to incorporate. If the rice 
                starts to stick to the pan, stir in a little more oil.
                Drizzle the soy sauce and sesame oil over the 
                rice and stir to incorporate. Stir in the cooked 
                chicken, scrambled eggs, and the dark parts of the 
                scallions. Stir briefly to bring it together, and 
                cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Taste, and add more soy sauce if necessary.    </li>
            <li>Serve immediately while hot</li>

        </ol>
